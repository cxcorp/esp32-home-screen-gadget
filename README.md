# esp32-clock-weather-bus-schedule-screen

Firmware for a ESP32-2432S032 2.8" TFT (resistive) touchscreen module to provide the following features:
- Clock
  * Synchronized via NTP
- Weather for the next 15 hours
  * Temperature and weather symbol, courtesy of the Finnish Meteorological Institute
- Public transport schedule for a couple of near bus/tram stops
  * Similar in style to the schedules you see on bus stops nowadays (https://omatnaytot.hsl.fi/createview).

The UI is implemented with LVGL. Their SquareLine Studio software was used to design the UIs, and export the bare UI elements into code. Based on the [esp32-smartdisplay library](https://github.com/rzeldent/esp32-smartdisplay)'s LVGL configs.
